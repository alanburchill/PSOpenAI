## DESCRIPTION
Communicate with ChatGPT interactively on the console.  
This command will wait for user input on the terminal. You type your question to ChatGPT and press Enter twice to send the question and see the answer from ChatGPT. You may then ask additional questions.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
PS C:\> Enter-ChatGPT -ApiKey 'YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY' -NoHeader
```

## PARAMETERS

### -Model
The name of model to use.
The default value is `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

```yaml
Type: String
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

### -SystemMessage
An optional text to set the behavior of the assistant.

```yaml
Type: String
Aliases: system, RolePrompt
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -Temperature
What sampling temperature to use, between `0` and `2`.  
Higher values like `0.8` will make the output more random, while lower values like `0.2` will make it more focused and deterministic.

```yaml
Type: Double
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -TopP
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.  
So `0.1` means only the tokens comprising the top `10%` probability mass are considered.

```yaml
Type: Double
Aliases: top_p
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -StopSequence
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Aliases: stop
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -MaxCompletionTokens
The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer.  
Maximum value depends on model. (`4096` for `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `8192` for `gpt-4`)

```yaml
Type: Int32
Aliases: max_completion_tokens
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -PresencePenalty
Number between `-2.0` and `2.0`.  
Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

```yaml
Type: Double
Aliases: presence_penalty
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -FrequencyPenalty
Number between `-2.0` and `2.0`.  
Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

```yaml
Type: Double
Aliases: frequency_penalty
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -TimeoutSec
Specifies how long the request can be pending before it times out.  
The default value is `0` (infinite).

```yaml
Type: Int32
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
```

### -MaxRetryCount
Number between `0` and `100`.  
Specifies the maximum number of retries if the request fails.  
The default value is `0` (No retry).  
Note : Retries will only be performed if the request fails with a `429 (Rate limit reached)` or `5xx (Server side errors)` error. Other errors (e.g., authentication failure) will not be performed.  

```yaml
Type: Int32
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 0
```

### -ApiBase
Specifies an API endpoint URL such like: `https://your-api-endpoint.test/v1`  
If not specified, it will use `https://api.openai.com/v1`

```yaml
Type: System.Uri
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### -ApiKey
Specifies API key for authentication.  
The type of data should `[string]` or `[securestring]`.  
If not specified, it will try to use `$global:OPENAI_API_KEY` or `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY`

```yaml
Type: Object
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -Organization
Specifies Organization ID which used for an API request.  
If not specified, it will try to use `$global:OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` or `$env:OPENAI_ORGANIZATION`

```yaml
Type: string
Aliases: OrgId
Required: False
Position: Named
```

### -NoHeader
Suppresses the display of header strings

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable.
